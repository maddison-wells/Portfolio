# Building My Portfolio with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Introduction

Creating my portfolio website was an exciting project that allowed me to showcase my skills, projects, and experiences to potential employers and collaborators. In this README, I'll walk you through my process of building the portfolio using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

Here's how I started building my portfolio:

HTML Structure: I began by setting up the HTML structure of my portfolio. I divided the content into sections such as navigation, about, details, skills, projects, contact, and footer. Each section had its corresponding HTML elements.

Styling: With the HTML structure in place, I moved on to styling my website using SCSS. I customised the appearance by adjusting colors, fonts, layouts, and other design elements to reflect my personal brand and aesthetic preferences.

JavaScript Functionality: Next, I added JavaScript functionality to enhance the interactivity of my portfolio.

External Resources: I included external resources such as Font Awesome for icons and Google Fonts for typography to enhance the visual appeal of my website and improve user experience.

Testing and Debugging: I tested my website across different devices and browsers to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. I debugged any issues that arose during testing to ensure a smooth user experience.g
